    "1. Is there a **pattern** to profound sentence?\n",

    "2. Can we develop a **subreddit classifier** to classify statements from r/oneliners (for mundane/shallow statements) vs r/quotes (for profound statements)?\n",

For a future application, it could even help us in filtering a long text to extract the important and profound information."
